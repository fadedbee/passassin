# passassin
A deterministic password generator, which uses HMAC SHA256.

* Passassin requests a master password and a website name.
* From these it generates a 16 character password which meets all common password rules. 
* Passassin will always generate the **same** password from any given pair of master password and website name.

DO NOT USE THIS YET as it is still under development.
